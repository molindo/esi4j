# esi4j - ElasticSearch Integration for Java

esi4j intends to help integrating [elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) into Java projects.

## Features

* Object Search Engine Mapping (OSEM) using [elasticsearch-osem](https://github.com/aloiscochard/elasticsearch-osem)
* Support for different data sources and data mirroring (Hibernate, JPA; extensible!)
* Batch indexing of data sources
* more?

## Compass Migration

esi4j is also intended to help migrating existing projects built with [Compass](http://compass-project.org/). It's however not planned to support legacy API. We rather want to support similar featurs in a similar manner.
